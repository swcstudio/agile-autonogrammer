- Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size

- Filter files by pattern with the include parameter (eg. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}")
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files containing specific patterns
- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead
