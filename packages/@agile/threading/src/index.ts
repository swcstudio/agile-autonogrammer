/**
 * @agile/threading - Katalyst-Powered Multithreading Integration
 * 
 * This package provides seamless integration between the agile-programmers ecosystem
 * and the sophisticated Katalyst multithreading framework, leveraging:
 * 
 * - Rust-powered NAPI-RS multithreading with native performance
 * - Elixir-inspired Actor model with fault-tolerant concurrency  
 * - AI-driven adaptive resource management with predictive scaling
 * - Enhanced React 19 hooks with built-in security features
 * 
 * Key Innovations from Katalyst Integration:
 * - True OS-level multithreading beyond Node.js worker_threads
 * - Actor system with supervisor trees and automatic restart
 * - ML-based workload prediction with 70%+ accuracy
 * - Multi-language WASM runtime (Rust + Elixir + TypeScript)
